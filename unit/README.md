# Unit Testing Challenge

1. Update dependencies/devDependencies in the `package.json`.
1. **Read** the files in the `src` folder.
   * You are not expected to make any changes to these files.
1. **Edit** the files in the `tests` folder.
   * For `helpers.test.js` add as many unit tests as you can think of.
   * For `linkWithFallback.test.js` just add a few tests.
1. Run `npm i && npm t` to see your tests run.
