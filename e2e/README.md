# End-to-End Testing Assessment

1. Update dependencies/devDependencies in the `package.json`.
1. Run `npm i && npm t`.
   * This should run without errors, pop up the playwright window and pass the single existing test.
   * If you run into issues at this point, reach out for assistance.
1. Follow the rest of the instructions in `assessment.test.js`.
1. You can also run `npm start` if you just want to play around with the page in a regular browser.
