#### Steps to Complete

1. Clone this repository locally.
1. If you do not already have Node.js and npm installed, we recommend using a Node Version Manager, like Volta:
   * [Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started) - Linux/OSX/Windows
   * [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) - Linux/OSX
1. Volta will automatically use the correct Node version. If you aren't using it, make sure you have Node.js 18+, with npm 8+, installed.
