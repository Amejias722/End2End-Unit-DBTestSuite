#### Steps to Complete

This repository is specific to you so you are free to make any changes you need to.

1. Clone this repository locally.

   * [Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started) - Linux/OSX/Windows

1. Volta will automatically use the correct Node version. If you aren't using it, make sure you have Node.js 18+, with npm 8+, installed.
1. If you have issues getting any of the subfolders to run, reach out for assistance.
