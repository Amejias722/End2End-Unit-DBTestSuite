## Overview 👩🏻‍💻

* This project is a mixture of different testing methods and divided into the following sections:

  * `e2e` - End-to-End testing assessment (Playwright) 🎭
  * `refactor` - Some messy/buggy JavaScript that needs cleaned up 🧹🧹
  * `unit` - Unit testing assessment (Vitest) ⚙️
  * `backend` - Backend assessment ⛁

#### Steps to Complete 
 If you do not already have Node.js and npm installed, we recommend using a Node Version Manager, like Volta:
   * [Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started) - Linux/OSX/Windows
   * [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) - Linux/OSX
Volta will automatically use the correct Node version. If you aren't using it, make sure you have Node.js 18+, with npm 8+, installed.
